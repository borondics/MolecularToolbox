# Molecular Toolbox

This package contains a collection of Python3 modules all aimed at solving quantum chemistry related problems/tasks. 

The toolbox provides classes for reading output files from Orca and Cfour, working with energies/gradients/Hessians, molecular geometries, harmonic and anharmonic force fields, Orca and Cfour input generation, thermodynamics.

**Requirements**: Python3.4 or higher, [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/) as well as the [ChemPhysConst](https://github.com/jdcapa/ChemPhysConst) package. A general scientific Python3 set-up guide is provided [here](https://jdcapa.github.io/python/science/coding/set-up/2016/06/06/scientific-python3.5.html).

## Install

Simply use `pip3` to install this package:

```{bash}
pip3 install --user git+https://github.com/jdcapa/MolecularToolbox
```
